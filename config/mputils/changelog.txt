# "ALREADY CONSTRUCTING VERTICALS"-Bug: If you should ever run into this issue as soon as you work with CropSticks:
   Replace JEI Version 301 with 302 and vis versa whenever the Bug occurs. I do my best to minimize the possible ocassions
# TiC Crafting Station displays (Vanilla) Chests as Missing Texture. Just a known Graphical Glitch. Nothing to worry about.
# Item Transfer Methods which run into any kind of bottleneck cause a lot of TPS Lag over Time!
# Using Stacked (Vanilla) Buckets on a Fluid Tank (FluidDrawers) returns/fills only a single one. 
# Random Things spectre energy nodes cause some energy storages to reset to 0 upon reaching 2.14B
# Crafting certain extended crafting recipes gets wonky so if it doesn't work take the items out then put them back in or restart the pack
# OC spamming some error in the logs in first load of a world
