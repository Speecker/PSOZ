v10.0.0-000	"Closed BETA - WIP" / "PSOZdev_Closed_BETA" / Early-Access-Release!
	Some Words About Version Changes and new Update Terminology:
		- 10.: Major Main Update: Preserved for Huge Updates/Changes to the pack. Hopefully there wont have to be made changes to the mods anymore.
								   I do my best to stick to the Modset of this (almost final) version.
			- 0.: Minor Main Updates: Preserved for overall content Implementations that is not yet available.
				- 0-: Polish Updates / Major Fixes etc. UX/UI Improvements/Tweaks/Feedback Implementation. Mod Updates for existing Mods.
					- 000:	Minor Bugfixes/Tweaks/Cleanup/Corrections/Changes/InternalPolishing.
		I decided to seperate the update number further into an additional part (.000) as i felt like the updates raised to fast up at high numbers which is unreasonable compared to the minor changes in most Of
		of the updates. The additional part should help you having a better overview over the changes and progression and help me beeing able to note even the slightest changes without unnecessarily bumping up high numbers.
		Small hint: i think about setting up something to review the packs overall goals and to see what yet has to be done 'til Open Beta can be released.
	Changes/Fixes/Etc.:
		- New Addon/Expansion Mods for Embers:
			- AetherWorks-1.12.2-1.0.0.3
			- Aetherium+Ashen+Armor-Release-1.12.2-1.2.1
		- Deduplication for ModularMachinery Recipes and noBlockify for Modularium Blocks
		- Replaced Alloy Smelter Multiplier Block Vent with Circuitry to make it harder to get and added a Color (4E2819)
		- Added: Recipe for Time Detector (DaylightSensor) and added it as Alloy Smelter Multiplier x4
		- Removed any Sub-ID from Duplicator & Hellforge Machine Construction Recipe so you can use any size
		- Duplicator Machine:
			- Buffed: Exchanged projectred-core:resource_item@105 (Electrotine) with lordcraft:void_catalyst
			- Nerfed: Changed Mekanism Basic Control Circuit Outputs from 10 to 5
			- Renamed: All .cfg to speecker_duplicator_xyz
			- Added: Recipe for Torchberries
		- NuclearCraft Script: Moved Tin Plate Recipe to Pressurizer and added Dust Recipe for Osmium in the Manufactory

		- Buffed: Mekanism Basic Tank Recipe to use Steel instead of Iron and RedAlloy instead of RedstoneDust
		- storagedrawers.cfg: Fixed: Eximite Conversion (Piece/Chunk)
		- Renamed: speecker_renameandtooltip_lordcraft_landia_oregen to speecker_renameandtooltip_landcraft_lordcraft
		- Added: Tooltips for Lordcraft _magic (dust/shard/ingot) to inform wich Tier of Arcane Forge is needed.
		- Modular Machinery: Arcane Contstruct:
			- Moved all Recipes to /speecker/speecker_arcane_construct
			- Renamed all to speecker_arcane_construct_xyz
			- Doubled all output amounts to encourage the user to use the Arcane Construct over the Arcane Forges and to make it feel more rewarding
		- Added: import crafttweaker.oredict.IOreDictEntry; inside speecker_oredict - hope that makes the oreDict Entries finally work as intended
		- Fixed minor missing items issues in Armor Tier I Recipes for specific materials
		- Added classicbar-0.5.4 and removed Health Points View from InGameInfoXML.json as its now obsolete.
			- Unfotunately theres no way to add in Armor Toughness like it works natively with AP/HP via IngameInfoXML (not even with an XML-Addon)
			- ClassicBar is therefore an alternative which shows all right out of the box (except speed)
			+ ClassicBar warns about low Armor/Health(/Hunger) Points
		- Changed "Extra Armor HUD" to false inside rustic.cfg as we have classicbar installed
		- Removed Mods as they became Obsolete:
			- AppleSkin-mc1.12-1.0.14 / AppleCore-mc1.12.2-3.4.0

			  Shouldnt be too cheap anyway as it allows you to use fly in any Morph when purchased.
		- Adepted: Set XML Alignment for Top Left to 50 from Top (Before it was 5). This is needed as the LordCraft HUD cant be moved and would be hidden behind XML.
		- LordCraft: Renamed All Spell Focuses to better distinguish them from each other as they are all called the same and just have different colors. The Rename should ease that off.
		- Added Adhesive back in as Slimeball as it is the intended use by Embers and has no other use then being an ingredient for a SimpleSponge
		- Added Tooltip for EnderIO PoweredSpawner to inform the user about TPS Chopping while using this machine
		- Added displayName Localizations for VoidCraft Items
		BetterQuesting:

v10.1.0.001
	Fixed some Uranium issues
	StorageDrawers Conversions:
		- Added all Botania Quartz Types
	QuantumFlux / Wireless Energy Transmission Mechanics Rework:
		As the WETMs are now fully progressive (QuantumFlux/RandomThings/FluxNetworks) and White Gem Wafers are used in the
		Quibit Crystal Recipe (Which served the purpose to make the Imaginary Time Block harder to craft (in OG PO3)) QuantumFlux became unreasonably/unlogically
		way too difficult as "Stage I" for those WETMs.
		To solve that inconveniences Following Changes are made:
			- renameandtooltip: added QuantumFlux dedicated file with 1st entry beeing a hint for Hyper Diamonds to be only created from Industrial Grade Graphite
			- speecker_beast_quantumflux: Quibit Cell Recipe now uses the White Gem Wafers, a Tier5 instead of Tier3 Quibit Cluster & RedQuartz for Redstone 
			- ExtendedCrafting 5x5 (Beast): Imaginary Time Block now uses a Quibit Cell instead of a Tier 3 Quibit Cluster and Exotic Materials Catalysts instead of Quibit Crystals
			- contentTweaker: Exotic Materials Catalyst now has a 5x5 ExtendedCrafting Recipe with a single Elite Catalyst surrounded by 24 White Gem Wafers
							  This serves as compensation for the 96 White Gem Wafers that would else fall apart
			- QuantumFlux: Quibit Crystal: Replaced the White Gem Wafers with Dilithium Crystals
						   (Which requires to either find Dilithium Ore in the world or make it from Blocks of Dilithium in a AbyssalCraft Crystallizer
						   ... or you make the Makenism "x5OreProcessingLine")
	BetterQuesting:
		- Omicron Page: Added AbyssalCraft Crystallizer Quest

	AgriCraft: "Single spread stat increase" was set to false to force the user to enhance the seeds by hand to prevent the VERTICALS ALREADY CONSTRUCTING Bug
				as it will most likely occur when spreading seeds from CropStick to CropStick. (Doesnt matter weather Single or Double). If (only) CrossBread
				is actively used with the Clipper & Rake it seems to be quite stable and the Bug may be avoided this way as the crops are always rendered right in front of the user.

	ModularMachinery:
		- Created new Machine "Compact Empowerer" which replaces the "Mechanical Empowerer" as it is too large. May be fully implemented or else overthrown later (Just disabled/Unused not removed).

	Alchemistry:
		- Renamed Fertilizer to Synthetic Fertilizer to distinguish it from IndustrialForegoing Fertizer as the PSOZ Resourcepack Unifies their Texture and

		- Compression Crafting: Fixed duplicate input of Crystal Ingots and replaced it with Crystal Plates for the Buttite Plate in BetaTesters

			- Knightslime Seeds use Slime Seeds for Pink Slime & Stone Seeds for Seared Stone

				v1.2.6:
					- Iron and Gold Decorative blocks are now unregistered when disabling a specific block types (#316)
					- Fixed Celenegil and Orichalcum effects being applied to Deep Iron and Shadow steel instead (#319)
					- Improved random mob metallurgy equipment generation performance
					- Fixed JEI Alloyer Recipes displaying wrong information when you changed some ingredients' oredict names (#317)
					- Fixed faulty CT integration that automatically converted other mods' materials to their metallurgy equivalents when adding custom recipes (#318)
				v1.2.7:

			- FoamFix from 0.10.11 to 0.10.14
					- See CurseForge for Changelog
		- Replaced:
			- EnderUtilities instead of ProjectStorage/PlayerStorage:	
				- Replaces ProjectStorage/PlayerStorage (& OverpoweredInventory (prior to PlayerStorage)) as a secondary large Inventory Solution as it is much more
				  stable, versatile and brings some additional utilities & useful mechanics with it as a side effect
				- One of the great benefits of it is being able to be very well Organized. There is also no direct 1-to-1 swap like OverPoweredInventory had,
				  but you can store a lot more items of the same type, move stuff around in a more or less similar manner.
				- Another reason why EnderUtilities was chosen over OverpoweredInventory & PlayerStorage is the fact that you are able to
				  just grab the whole inventory by card and place/use it in a Chest, which was missing in ProjectStorage/PlayerStorage
				  (There was a version of this mod with some kind of disposal block & internal Fluid Tanks but these were always laggy and buggy/glitchy)
				- Also EnderUtilities is more likely to recieve further support/updates/fixes etc.
				- Empty your PlayerStorage Inventory before updating/removing the mod if you want to keep the items inside
		(- Forge got an update from 14.23.5.2854 to 14.23.5.2855 - feel free to use it without any worries)
	BetterQuesting:
		- Fixed the Copper Armor Quest still using Thermal Series Variant. Metallurgy Copper Armor is now used for the Quest as it is the prefered one of the two similar.
		(- Metallurgy Copper Armor has slightly better stats than Thermal Series Copper Armor)

		- Progressive Recipes are now done
		- Progressive Ranges, Energy Values & Harvest Levels are now done
		- Energy Values are now shown in RF instead of FE

		- BuildingGadgets Recipes now use Ultiimate Exchanger as this is now the top tier Exchanger
