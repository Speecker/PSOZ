V1.2
	- Added PSOZ Headers
v1.3
	- Fixed Localization Paths References to match directories
	- Fixed/Changed TableCasting to BasinCasting
v1.4
	- Added Own File metallurgyTweaksCustomIntegrations to let Metallurgy Machines make use of the OreDict Entries rather then Metallurgy-Metals only
	  This way other Mods Metals cane be used instead inside Metallurgy Machines. (Main Reason I Did This: UniDict with keepOneEntry: true)
		- General OreDict Entry Variables for the Metallurgy Alloyer - DONE
		- General OreDict Entry Variables for the Metallurgy Crusher - WIP
